# odin-recipes
This is an entry project pulled from The Odin Project to show off html, and later add css.

This project started with little design consistancy, and over the time of completion I implimented the following:

*Homepage with spaced items, all with consistant spacing and size using flexbox
*Individual item pages that used css grid for both image and text layout
*Separate image sets for recipe pages
*CSS box-shadow animation to highlight the image as a "go back home," clickable item
