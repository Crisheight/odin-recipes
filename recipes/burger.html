            <h3><h2 class="subtitle__size"><u>Directions</u></h2>
                <ol class="list__size">
                    <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat just until the fat is rendered out. Before the bacon begins to brown, 
                        remove all but 4 slices of bacon and place in a food processor. <br>Continue to cook the remaining 4 slices until lightly crispy 
                        and remove to a paper towel. Keep the bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
                    <li>Place the buns, cut side down, into the warm bacon fat and toast until golden brown around the edges. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Pulse the undercooked bacon in the food processor until it is coarsely ground - approximately 30-45 seconds. Transfer the bacon 
                        to a large mixing bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper to the bowl and use your hands to gently work the bacon and seasonings 
                        into the ground beef.</li>
                    <li>Divide the meat into 4 portions. Loosely pack each portion to make patties. Then use your thumb to create an indention in the 
                        center of each patty. </li>
                    <li>Preheat the grill and generously oil the grates. Once the grill is hot, place the patties on the grates and cook for 3-5 minutes 
                        per side.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the grill and top each patty with a slice of desired cheese on top. Cover the grill to allow it to melt.</li>
                    <li>Assemble the burgers and top with one bacon slice cut in half, lettuce, and/or tomato. *Add additional condiments as desired.</li>
                </ol>
