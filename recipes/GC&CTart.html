            <li>¾ cup heavy cream </li>
        </ul>

    </h3>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3><ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. 
        </li>
        
        <li>Mix pretzel crumbs, brown sugar, melted butter, and salt together in a bowl until mixture resembles wet sand. <br>
            Pour into the tart pan, and press very firmly and evenly up the sides and into the bottom of the pan.
        </li>
        
        <li>Place tart pan onto a baking sheet and bake until crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. <br>
            Allow crust to cool completely in pan, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        
        <li>Combine heavy cream, butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and cook until butter is <br>
            melted and mixture begins to bubble, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, set aside, and keep warm.
        </li>
        
        <li>Combine sugar, corn syrup, and water in a large light-colored saucepan with high sides. Cook over medium heat, swirling occasionally, <br>
            until mixture is amber in color, 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and very carefully whisk in reserved cream-butter mixture, <br>
            as caramel mixture will bubble up and steam; stir constantly.
        </li>
        
        <li>Insert a candy thermometer into the mixture and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until caramel reaches 245 degrees F (118 degrees C), 25 to 30 minutes. <br>
            Carefully pour caramel into an even layer in the baked and cooled crust. Allow caramel layer to cool until set, 1 to 2 hours. 
        </li>
        
        <li>Prepare the chocolate layer. Pour stout beer into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until stout has been reduced to 1/4 cup, 20 to 25 minutes. <br>
            Pour reduced stout into a large bowl. Stir in chopped chocolate, chocolate chips, butter, and vanilla and set aside.
        </li>
        
        <li>Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until just simmering, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour over chocolate and allow to sit for 5 minutes. <br>
            Stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Carefully pour melted chocolate over the cooled caramel layer, making sure not overflow the pan. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a toothpick to pop any air bubbles that may arise. Allow chocolate layer to cool and set up completely, 1 to 2 hours.
        </li>
    </ol></h3>
